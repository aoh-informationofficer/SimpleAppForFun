    # we can use straegy and matrix to determine weather which version we want to use for our npm items.
    # example: node version, or python or npm version so on
    # matrix means we will want to run all our script with the same versions of install that we are using

    # env are environment variable. (we can use something called github secret if we need to instead as well)
